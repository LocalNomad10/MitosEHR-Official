<h1>Extensible</h1>

<h2>An Ext JS Component Library</h2>

<p>by Brian Moeskau</p>

<h2>Current Status</h2>

<p>Extensible should currently be considered <strong>alpha quality code</strong>. Although a stable version of this code was contributed to the Ext JS 3.3 release, the code here is currently under heavy revision and is not yet feature-complete or guaranteed to be free of bugs.</p>

<h2>Building the Source</h2>
<p>Currently the only build script is a Mac/Unix shell script (<code>build/build.sh</code>).  I'll plan on adding a matching Windows batch file soon.  You must have a current version of Java installed for JSBuilder to work.  You must also edit the build script (build.sh) and update the path variables as needed for your system.</p>
<p>If you run the build script (e.g., "sh build.sh" in the Mac terminal) it will build everything, create a <code>/deploy</code> folder and also place the *-all files in the root folder.  The jar file for the Ext-doc tool ("http://ext-doc.org/":http://ext-doc.org/) is also included.  If you'd like to generate docs, edit the build script and uncomment the doc generation block.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you would prefer not to build the source yourself, you can also "download":http://github.com/bmoeskau/Extensible/downloads the latest available build.</p>

<h2>Installation and Usage</h2>

<p>Extensible requires the Ext JS framework (version 3.2 or later). You should download the "latest version":http://www.sencha.com/products/js/download.php of Ext JS and install Extensible in a sibling directory.</p>

<p>To use Extensible in your application simply include the base Extensible file after the standard Ext JS includes. For example:</p>

<p><pre><code>
    <!-- Ext JS includes -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://extjs.cachefly.net/ext-3.2.0/resources/css/ext-all.css" />
    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://extjs.cachefly.net/ext-3.2.0/adapter/ext/ext-base-debug.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://extjs.cachefly.net/ext-3.2.0/ext-all-debug.js"></script>

    <!-- Extensible includes -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="path/to/extensible-all.css" />
    <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/extensible-all.js"></script>
</code></pre></p>

<p>If you are using individual source files then it's up to you to include them all, in the proper order. Look under the <code>/examples</code> folder to get a jump start on how to use the included components.</p>

<h2>Licensing</h2>
<p>Currently Extensible is licensed under the GPL v3.  Additionally we plan to offer commercial license options for anyone who does not wish to be bound by the GPL.  Commercial licenses are not yet available, but will be available prior to the 1.0 release.  Extensible will be dual-licensed under the same terms as Ext JS itself.</p>
