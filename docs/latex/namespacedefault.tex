\-Database \-Helper \-Class.

\-Description\-: \-A \-P\-D\-O helper for \-Mitos\-E\-H\-R, contains custom function to manage the database in \-Mitos\-E\-H\-R. \-P\-D\-O is new in \-P\-H\-P v5

\-The \-P\-H\-P \-Data \-Objects (\-P\-D\-O) extension defines a lightweight, consistent interface for accessing databases in \-P\-H\-P. \-Each database driver that implements the \-P\-D\-O interface can expose database-\/specific features as regular extension functions. \-Note that you cannot perform any database functions using the \-P\-D\-O extension by itself; you must use a database-\/specific \-P\-D\-O driver to access a database server.

\-P\-D\-O provides a data-\/access abstraction layer, which means that, regardless of which database you're using, you use the same functions to issue queries and fetch data. \-P\-D\-O does not provide a database abstraction; it doesn't rewrite \-S\-Q\-L or emulate missing features. \-You should use a full-\/blown abstraction layer if you need that facility.

\-P\-D\-O ships with \-P\-H\-P 5.\-1, and is available as a \-P\-E\-C\-L extension for \-P\-H\-P 5.\-0; \-P\-D\-O requires the new \-O\-O features in the core of \-P\-H\-P 5, and so will not run with earlier versions of \-P\-H\-P.
