h1. Release Notes

h2. 1.0 (RC 1)

_Jan. 26, 2011_

*New Features*
* Lots of new options to customize the time increments and boundaries that can be shown (<tt>showHourSeparator</tt>, <tt>viewStartHour</tt>, <tt>viewEndHour</tt>, <tt>scrollStartHour</tt>, <tt>hourHeight</tt>, <tt>ddIncrement</tt>, <tt>minEventDisplayMinutes</tt>). This enables highly customizable calendar layouts, as shown in the new sample custom-views.html.
* New option <tt>enableEditDetails</tt> to hide/show the "edit details" link on the edit window
* New sample doc-types.php for easily testing various HTML doctype combinations
* Catalan and Spanish (Spain) locale files

*Bugs Fixed*
* Day/week header does not display when using many doctype combinations
* Removed store override that could break other data bound components that rely on phantom record support
* Click on week view all day header with no events present always shows first date of week in edit window
* "More events" popup window should exclude events from hidden calendars
* <tt>CalendarList.radioCalendar</tt> causes many unnecessary store.load calls
* Event store reloaded improperly when <tt>view.refresh</tt> is passed as a callback function
* String calendar ids should be allowed
* End date boundary bug in <tt>isEventVisible</tt>
* Revised event overlap logic for day/week views to support minimum event display height
* WeekView sometimes stays on the same week when moving forward/back using the arrow buttons
* MemoryEventStore's add event listener gets overwritten when other listeners are added by external code (applies to samples only)

h2. 1.0 (Beta 1)

_Dec. 9, 2010_

*API Changes*
* The default value for <tt>CalendarView.dateParamFormat</tt> is now 'Y-m-d' (instead of 'm-d-Y'). This was done for consistency and also because it is a more sensible default. If you are currently using the default format and handling it on your server you may need to either set this config to the old value or change the date format expected on the back end to match 'Y-m-d'.

*New Features*
* Full localization support + new sample with 4 locales
* Full remote error handling support (fully tested using the DataWriter API)
* Basic read-only calendar support
* New config to enable/disable event resizing in day/week view
* New config option to enable event editor window as modal
* New config to force a static startDay in the MultiDayView to allow for custom views

*Bugs Fixed*
* Calendar display bug for events spanning sat-sun in some cases
* Multiple GET requests on day/week view load
* Initial page load no longer executes GET with no date params
* Selected calendar date now persists consistently across page navigation
* Overlapping event display bug in day/week view for events < 30 minute duration
* Update event via DnD causes multiple duplicate PUTs
* startDay != 0 causes several boundary display bugs
* Replaced HTML char entities with XHTML-compliant codes
* Missing rounded corners on events in IE
* Null error after setting showTodayText = false
